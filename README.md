# XMLCalculator

This application takes two files: the first file is a list of cities with their populations and areas, and the second file is a list of operations to be performed on the cities list. Both the files are XMLs. The operations list has a filter and operation type attributes, based on this the cities are filtered and the corresponding operations are performed. The operation results are stored in another XML file. For example, the cities whose name starts with M are filtered and the mean operation is performed on the population attribute.
